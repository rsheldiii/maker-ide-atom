# maker-ide-atom package

##Note!

hey guys! this isn't my repo, this was originally an omniblox repo that has since been taken offline. Feel free to install this as a development package in atom but I currently have no control over the atom package, sorry :/

Tools for Makers - an atom extension

Currently this will enable users to:
* view STL files
* view BRD files
* view SVG files
* edit and view JSCAD files
* call out to external app for 3D printing of STL files (defaults to [Cura](https://ultimaker.com/en/products/cura-software))
* call out to external app for the milling of BRD files (defaults to [Otherplan](https://othermachine.co/otherplan/))
